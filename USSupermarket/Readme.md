4. Predict what customers purchase.

## EDA
The first step is to explore the data set, you may find more details on the [EDA folder](EDA).

## A/B Testing
After looking at the customer data set, I would like to learn more about the relationship between customers and spending score. In this phase, we will raise questions about the business and answer the questions by conducting A/B testing. Please find the findings and result in the [A/B testing folder](Abtesting). The folder includes the python code which conduct A/B testing and result in text files.

## Interpret the Spending Effects on Profit
The supermarket chain provides a data set on spending and profit of the each store located. We would like to interpret how the spendings have an effect on profit of each store. Please find more detail and interpretation in the [Interpretation folder](Interpretation).

## Build a Dashboard on Supermarket Chain Customer Demographic
We have built a dashboard for management to look at the customer demographic effectively. Please find more detail and the dashboard screenshot in the [Customer Dashboard folder](CustomerDashboard).

## Predict what Customers Purchase
The supermarket wants to understand what the customers put in their basket. In this phase, we will predict what customers purchase based on what the customers historically purchase in the basekets and display the result on a dashboard. Please find more detail and the dashboard screenshot in the [Basket Prediction folder](BasketPrediction).

## Conclusion
In this part of the project, we have helped management to optimize sales by A/B testing, interpretation of spending effects, and develop dashboards to help understand the data insight. The core of this part of project is to use different approach to help management to make data-driven business decision, and I believe we have achieved our goals. Although this part of the project is made for hypothetical situation, the findings and tools developed are helpful for the management of the US supermarket chain.
