# Sales Analytics of Burma Supermarkets
This is one part of the Sales Analytics Project. The data set is a selective data set on supermarket transactions in 3 different supermarkets in Burma. The goal of this part is to find interesting data insight and make prediction models for this Burma supermarket chain.

## Data
The data is obtained from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales">Kaggle</a>.

Please find more detail in the [Data Folder](Data)

## Data Exploration
I used Tableau to visualize some data insight before training prediction models to explore and understand more about the data set itself. Please find the findings and insight in the [EDA folder](EDA). The folder includes the Tableau files that creates the visualization and the images of visualizations.

## A/B Testing
After performed the exploratory data analysis, I am interested about whether the sales of member is higher than the sales of non-member. Please find the findings and result in the [ABtesting folder](/ABtesting). The folder includes the findings, result, and codes which run the analysis.


## ModelTraining
Another goal of this part is to make a prediction model. In this [ModelTraining folder](ModelTraining), I will go over how to build the prediction model. This folder includes the codes and result of the model training phase. 


## Prediction Model
This [PredictionModel folder] consists the code and description of the prediction model on predicting sales. (Coming Soon)
