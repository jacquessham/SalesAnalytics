## Data
There are 2 files in this part of the project. The original data set originated from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hsinha53/car-sales">Kaggle</a> contains the lifetime sales of each car model available in the dealership. The other data set is the car model which is not available in the dealership for sales prediction in the same format with the original data. You may find more detail in the [Data folder](Data).

The data set available in this part:
* Car_sales.csv - The original data
